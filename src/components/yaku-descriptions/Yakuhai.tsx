    Yakuhai is scored when a player's hand contains a triplet of a value honor
    tile. A value honor tile is defined as a player's seat wind, the round wind,
    or any dragon. Each yakuhai triplet in a hand is scored in a winning hand --
    for example, triplets of both the green and red dragons are worth 1 han
    each.
